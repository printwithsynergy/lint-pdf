 * Viewer host context — the bridge between an embedding application

 *
 * Phase 2 (this directory) extracts the context that was previously
 * defined in `src/types.ts` (`ViewerApiContextValue` / `ViewerApiContext`
 * / `useViewerApi`) so `src/core/` no longer needs to import from
 * `../../types`. The boundary rule that blocks `core/` from
 * referencing the LintPDF directory couldn't catch `../../types`
 * imports — this move closes that gap.
 *
 * Phase 3 (LoupePDF) extracts this directory, alongside everything
 * else under `src/core/`, into `@thinkneverland/loupe-pdf`. Hosts
 * (LintPDF SaaS, OSS embeds) supply their own concrete values via
 * `<ViewerHostContext.Provider value={...}>`.
 *
 * The legacy `useViewerApi` / `ViewerApiContext` names are still
 * re-exported from `src/types.ts` so components outside `core/` (and
 * downstream consumers) can keep their existing imports.
